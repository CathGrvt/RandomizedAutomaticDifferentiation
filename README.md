# Randomized Automatic Differentiation

This repository contains code for all three types of experiments used in the paper:
1. Feedforward network experiments described in ``README_ff.md``
2. Recurrent network experiments described in ``README_rnn.md``
3. PDE experiments described in ``README_diffusionsim.md``

For the neural network experiments, the actual randomized autodiff implementations are in ``layers.py``.
