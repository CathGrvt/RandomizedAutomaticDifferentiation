# Randomized Automatic Differentiation

This repository contains code for all three types of experiments used in the paper:
1. Feedforward network experiments described in ``nn_experiments/README_ff.md``
2. Recurrent network experiments described in ``nn_experiments/README_rnn.md``
3. PDE experiments described in ``diffusionsim_experiments/README_diffusionsim.md``

For the neural network experiments, the layers using randomized autodiff are in ``nn_experiments/layers.py``.
